        <h3><strong><i>The <span id="red">Red</span> Maple</i></strong></h3>

        <br>

        <p>Red Maples&lpar;<em>Acer rubrum</em>&rpar;, are most known for their vibrant red and orange leaves that paint a colorful picture in the fall. Onlookers from all around the world flock to areas where the tree is plentiful to take in such beautiful displays of color. Don't be fooled by their name, their leaves can actually vary in color from yellow to red and you cannot guarantee the color of a Red Maple tree grown from a seed.</p> 

        <p>Red Maples go by several names, including swamp maple, water maple, or soft maple because of their ability to adapt to a wide range of site conditions. This deciduous tree is the most widespread tree in eastern North America ranging from eastern Canada, south to Florida and west to East Texas. It's a medium to large size tree that grows relatively fast reaching average heights between 60 and 90 feet. Some of the larger Red Maples can top out over 120 feet when growing conditions are optimized. With an average lifespan of 80 to 100 years, these trees live to be moderately old in tree standards.</p>
        
        <p>But there's much more to these trees than just their autumn beauty. Red Maples are significant contributors to our daily lives making them a beloved and versatile tree species. We invite you to explore our website further to learn more about Red Maples, their habitat, uses, and, of course, their breathtaking foliage.
